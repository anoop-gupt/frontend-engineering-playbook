### Dependencies
Please note that for now, producing a better book is the primary goal. All other things being equal, an easier to build book is better than a harder to build book, but, for example, a better illustration that relies on a new tool is better than a worse illustration.

## Code Linting

Linting is the process of running a program that analyzes your code for programmatic and stylistic errors. A linting tool, or a linter, marks or flags any potential errors in your code such as syntax errors or incorrectly spelled variable names. This can save time and help you write better code.

Linters can be installed using npm or another package manager. Linters can be used from the command line by passing in files. Linters are also available as plugins for tools and sometimes they are directly integrated into editors.

Javascript Linters:

 - [JSLint](http://www.javascriptlint.com/online_lint.php)

 - [JSHint](http://jshint.com/)

 - [JSCS](http://jscs.info/)

 - <img src="./assests/eslint.svg" alt="Stylelint" title="A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript. Maintain your code quality with ease." width="16" height="16" /> [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)

CSS Linters:

  - <img src="./assests/stylelint.png" alt="Stylelint" title="A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your styles." width="16" height="16" /> [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) 
  
  - [SCSS Lint](https://github.com/sds/scss-lint)

### Linters for Editors :
Visual Code: To Install the eslint extension, open command palette (View -> Command Palette.. or cmd+shift+p ) and execute command: `ext install eslint`

### Tools and Plugins
[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
