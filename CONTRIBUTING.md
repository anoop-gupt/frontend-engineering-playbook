## Contributor Code of Conduct
By contributing you agree to respect the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com//anoop-gupt/frontend-engineering-playbook/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) of this repository.

## In a nutshell
1. You don't have to know Git: if you found something of interest which is *not already in this repo*, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/frontend-engineering-playbook/issues) with your links propositions.
    - If you know Git, please Fork the repo and send pull requests.
2. We have topics. Choose the right one as per your knowedge and create the content under respective sections.If you can't find the folder under sections, just create it.
3. Make sure to follow the [guidelines below](#guidelines) and respect the [Markdown formatting](#formatting) of the files.



### Guidelines
- Please use original content as much as you can
- If content is being copied from somewhere, give the credit and update the reference
- if a resource exists at different places on the Internet
    + use the link with the most authoritative source (meaning author's website is better than editor's website is better than third party website)
- include the author name or names where appropriate. 
- if the content is not finished, and is still being worked on, add the "Work in process" notation, as described [below.](#in_process)

### Formatting
- All lists are `.md` files. Try to learn [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax. It's simple!
- All the topics start with an Index. The idea is to list and link all sections and subsections there. Keep it in alphabetical order.
- Sections are using level 3 headings (`###`), and subsections are level 4 headings (`####`).

The idea is to have
- `2` empty lines between last paragraph and new section
- `1` empty line between heading & first link of its section
- `0` empty line between two paragraph
- `1` empty line at the end of each `.md` file
