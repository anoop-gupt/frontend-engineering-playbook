## Code Linting

Linting is the process of running a program that analyzes your code for programmatic and stylistic errors. A linting tool, or a linter, marks or flags any potential errors in your code such as syntax errors or incorrectly spelled variable names. This can save time and help you write better code.

Linters can be installed using npm or another package manager. Linters can be used from the command line by passing in files. Linters are also available as plugins for tools and sometimes they are directly integrated into editors.
