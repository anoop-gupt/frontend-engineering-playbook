### Choose Your Project Size
Project sizing â€“ How big (or important) is the project?
A project sizing matrix is a good tool to use in assessing the relative magnitude of a project. For example, projects are sized in categories of small, medium, and large projects 
- Samll Application
- Medium Enterprise Application
- Large Enterprise Application

Various factors can influence the size and complexity of the project like duration,team size, integration points etc. 

| Factors              | Small         | Medium  | Large |
| ---------------------|:-------------| :-----| :-------|
| Duration             | 6 Months or less | 6 to 12 months | 12 months or more |
| Team Size            | Less than 5 members      |   5 to 20 Members | 20 or more |
| Integration Points   | Mimimal integration      |   Moderate integration with other systems | significant integration with other systems |

Short duration projects with small team member can be a high value projects. So based on the value and other factors tech stack and architecture should be choosen. Over engineering or experiment should not be done in these kind of projects.
